Description: This package contains a pipeline to compute copy number 
          segmentation on WES paired BAM files based on a variational 
          based segmentaion algorithm, VEGAWES. It reads in paired normal-tumor BAM files, 
          computes average read coverage, removes incorrect reads and GC Content bias, and 
          finally segments the data for copy number classification.
